Computational Thinking

computer science is about solving a problem

you have an 'input' -> " code " -> 'output'
there are different systems to use such as unary, and binary
Unary is (imagine) one finger at a time

computers speak in One's and Zero's
0's mean OFF
1's mean ON

<!--
ex. a single light bulbcan only count from zero to one
	but imagine using more than one light bulb, now there is more options available

	using three light bulbs, this can be considered Zero:
	0 0 0

	this can be considered One
	0 0 1
	
	this can be considered Two
	0 1 0

	this can be considered Three
	0 1 1

	this can be considered Four
	1 0 0
	
	Five
	1 0 1

	Six
	1 1 0

	Seven
	1 1 1

Base-2 (Binary)
decimal is base-10 (what we use as humans)

computers will simplify and use a different base which is used to describe ON or OFF

this is the reason " 0 0 0 " = OFF OFF OFF = the number Zero

Three bits will only equal up to the number Seven
adding another bit can equal higher number and so on
computers generally use eight bits to represent a numbers

<!--
Representation
how does 0 and 1 represent numbers, but what will represent letters?

we would be using 8 bits

ASCII
language mapping system

ex. receiving a bit such as:
	01001000 01001001 0100001

	which would equal to:
	72 73 33

	which would then represent the letters and punctuation as:
	H I !
-->

<!--
Emojis
ASCII historically used 7 bits to represent the american alphabet
the solution to add more letters or symbols would be by adding another bit

Unicode
can ensure that theres representation of other languages and have enough room to add emoji or picture representations

emojis are now added and are considered characters
- can also be a different font (iOS emojis vs android emoji)

within emojis, you can modify the display of skin tones by having a structured emoji first then adding a pattern of bits to add the 'variety'

RGB
to represent a color there is a number representing how much red, green, and blue should be shown

ex. to continue to use the example of 72 73 33:
	the red being 72
	the green being 73
	the blue being 33

	representing a particular shade of yellow

Images, Video and Sound
-images are collections of RGB values
-videos are sequences of several images that are stored together with continuously changing RGB values
-musical notes are represented by MIDI, mp3, wav, and so on...

Algorithms
problem-solving is central to computer science and programming

ex. imagine the basic problem of trying to locate a	
single name in a phone book
	
	a final option would be to go to the middle of the phone book and ask whether the name is to the right or left
		then repeat the process

	an approach like this could be called an algorithm
		the speed of each algorithm can be pictures as the big-o notation

	we would want out algorithm to make a logarithmic curve such as (log2 (n)) where it represents a short time to solve as well as minimizing the size of the problem

<!--
Pseudocode and Programming Building Blocks
ability to create Pseudocode is extremely beneficial

	1. pick up phone book
	2. open to middle of phone book
	3. look at page
	4. if person is on page
	5. 	call person
	6. else if the person is earlier in the book
	7. 	open to middle of left half book
	8. 	go back to line 3
	9. else if person is later in book
	10.  open to middle of right half of book
	11.  go back to line 3
	12. else
	13.  quit

before creating formal code, pseudocode allows you to think through the logic of the problem in advance
you can also later provide this info to others that are seeking to understand the coding decisions and how the code works

within the example above notice the 'verb' at the 			beginning of the lines
then notice states such as: 'if' or 'else if'
third, notice how there is statements that can be states 	as true or false (BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS)
finally notice how these statements like loops: 'go back 	to line 3'
	
in context /Scratch provides basic building blocks for programming
